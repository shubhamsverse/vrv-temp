# User Management Dashboard with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Project Overview

This project is a **User Management Dashboard** that simulates a role-based access control (RBAC) system. It allows users to manage, filter, and sort users with different roles and permissions. The dashboard is built using React and Material UI to provide a clean and modern interface. It includes features for adding, updating, and deleting users, along with the ability to filter users by status and role, and search by name or ID.

### Key Features:
- **User Management**: Add, update, and delete users.
- **Role Management**: Assign users different roles from a predefined list.
- **Permissions**: Assign permissions (read, write, update, delete) to users.
- **Search & Filter**: Search users by name or ID, and filter users by status and role.
- **Sorting**: Sort users by ID or name.

## Technologies Used:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material UI**: A popular React UI framework for fast and easy design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For state management, API calls, and functionality.
- **React Router**: For routing between components.
- **Mock Data**: The app uses mock data for users and roles, simulating server-side API calls.
